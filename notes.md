# Notes for 260

## Startup Misc.
- You'll have less than 4GB of space to store data in your database
    - Check if local storage is a possibility

## GitHub Assignment:

When resolving a merge conflict, remember to save the file after you choose the resolution! Then use `git add` plus the filename, then commit, then push (I think?).

Basically, avoid merge conflicts like the plague...

## Asking Questions - Order of Authority
- Yourself (especially when you're stuck and debugging)
    - Figure out how to phrase your question - nobody will be able to help you anyway until you do
- Instructions, automated sources (internet, etc.)
- Peers
- Teaching Assistants - there's a schedule, and a specific TA will grade your stuff
- Instructors

## Discord
- RubberDuck in the duckpond - a bot that will answer some questions
- Try to put technical questions in a category in general

## The Seven Major Structures You Must Use in Your Startup
- HTML - the structure
- CSS - how the structure is visualized. The style. Makes it pretty.
- JavaScript - interaction - how the user and server do stuff
- Service - web service endpoints - ex. getting the weather info from another server
- Database/Login - Persistent app and auth data - will use mongo
- WebSocket - Data pushed from server, chat - bidirectional chat
    - Push notifications
    - The server can tell you things, instead of just you requesting things and the server sending it
    - Sending reminders at a certain time is an example of WebSocket!
