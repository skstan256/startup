# Notes for 260

## GitHub Assignment:

When resolving a merge conflict, remember to save the file after you choose the resolution! Then use `git add` plus the filename, then commit, then push (I think?).

Basically, avoid merge conflicts like the plague...

## Asking Questions - Order of Authority
- Yourself (especially when you're stuck and debugging)
    - Figure out how to phrase your question - nobody will be able to help you anyway until you do
- Instructions, automated sources (internet, etc.)
- Peers
- Teaching Assistants - there's a schedule, and a specific TA will grade your stuff
- Instructors

## Discord
- RubberDuck in the duckpond - a bot that will answer some questions
