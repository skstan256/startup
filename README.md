## Elevator Pitch
Our brains have too many things to keep track of. Mix in ADHD, executive functioning problems, or working memory deficits, and it's just plain hard! Enter Web-Brain, a place to put your thoughts mid-project so your mind has room to thrive. Web-Brain has nifty spots to thought dump, make a to-do list, and set reminders! Organize by project and switch between them whenever the mood strikes you. Let Web-Brain keep track of the details and go wild!

## Description of Key Features
### Account
Users can create an account to store and access their projects.
### Projects
#### Thought Log
Record your thoughts in text chain style entries that can be edited or deleted. This is a way to keep track of your thought process, mind dump, rubber duck, etc.
#### To-Do List
A standard, simple to-do list. Keep track of tasks on the fly without navigating to another website (and maybe getting distracted in the process).
#### Reminders
Nudge yourself to do tasks after a certain amount of time, or when you pause/end your work session. This can also be used for a pomodoro timer.
