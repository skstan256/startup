## Elevator Pitch
Our brains have too many things to keep track of. Mix in ADHD, executive functioning problems, or working memory deficits, and it's just plain hard! Enter Web-Brain, a place to put your thoughts mid-project so your mind has room to thrive. Web-Brain has nifty spots to thought dump, make a to-do list, and set reminders! Organize by project and switch between them whenever the mood strikes you. Let Web-Brain keep track of the details and go wild!
